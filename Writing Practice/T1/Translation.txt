Dear Jane,

I hope you're well. I'm writing to ask for your help with a document that I need to have translated into French.

As you know, I've been given the opportunity to spend a semester at a business school in Paris. Well, they've asked me to provide a translated copy of my degree certificate along with the original.

I've been told that I must submit both documents this week in order to secure my place on the course. They will give my place to someone else if I don't get the translation done; I'm running out of time, and you're my only hope!

Do you think you could do me a big favour and give me an hour or so of your time either tomorrow or Wednesday? It shouldn't take you long to translate the certificate, and I can come to see you whenever suits you best.

If you're able to help, just let me know when you'd like me to pop round.

Speak soon,

Jony
