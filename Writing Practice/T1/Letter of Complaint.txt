Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to complain about the unacceptable state of the male changing room at the Sprint Sports complex.

I have been using the gym at your centre for several year now, and it would appear that no maintenance work has been carried out on the changing room facilities in all that time. As a result, paint is peeling off the walls, floor tiles are cracked, and there is mould and mildew growing around the showers.

The neglected and shabby state of the changing room makes me think that you do not care about your customers. I feel that we are being treated like farm animals, and I worry that you are putting our health at risk. It seem that profit is more important than the customer experience.

Please address the changing room issue as a matter of urgency. I suggest that a full refurbishment is required, and that you should consider some form of compensation for members. We have tolerated this situation for too long.

Yours faithfully,

Boris Johnson
