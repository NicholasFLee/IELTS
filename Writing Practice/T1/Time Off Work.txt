Dear Mr. Smith,

I am writing to ask for some time off work next month.

The reason for this request is that my brother is getting married. His future wife is Australian, and the wedding will take place in her home city, Melbourne. As the brother of the groom, I cannot miss such a special occasion.

To attend the ceremony and make the round trip from the UK, I would need at least five days off work. However, I would like to take the opportunity to do some sightseeing in Australia, and so I am hoping that you will allow me to take a full two weeks' leave, from the 1st to the 15th fo May.

I have spoken to my co-workers, and it seems that Peter Jones would be best placed to cover my project commitments while I am away. I will leave detailed instructions for him on my desk.

I hope that my request does not cause you any inconvenience.

Yours sincerely,

Jonathan Hall
