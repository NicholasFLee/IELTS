Dear Mark,

I hope you're well and that you had a fantastic time on your birthday.

I'm so sorry that I wasn't there to celebrate with you, and for not letting you know beforehand that I wouldn't be able to come. I feel terrible that I haven't found the time to contact you until now.

The truth is that I've been under a lot of stress at work recently. I was in danger of losing my job if I didn't meet a sales target, so I haven't been able to think about anything else over the last few weeks. This is why I couldn't be at your party, and why I didn't call to tell you I wouldn't be there.

I really hope you'll forgive me for being so thoughtless, and I hope you'll let me make it up to you. By way of an apology, I've bought tickets for us both to go to the football next Saturday; I hope you'll come.

Speak to you soon,

Jony
