Dear Sir,

I am writing to thank you and your staff for making our celebration meal so special last Friday evening.

I made a booking for ten people at very short notice on Friday, and you managed to find us a table. When we made the spontaneous decision to eat out that evening, we were amazed to find a table for such a large group, and we could not have chosen a better restaurant.

The ten of us were celebrating our university graduation. The ceremony had taken place, and my friends and I were all so relieved to have finally received our degree certificates. Nobody wanted to go home, so I suggested that we find somewhere to have dinner together.

As soon as we walked into the restaurant, we knew that we were in good hands. Your waiters were extremely friendly and obliging, and the food was delicious. We were also impressed that both you and the head chef came to check that everyone was happy with their food.

All ten of us would like to thank you for giving us such a memorable evening.

Yours faithfully,

Hanna Schmitt
