Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to recommend Helen Jones for the position of Director of Studies at Manchester Language School. Having worked closely with Helen for almost five years, I am very pleased to provide this reference in support of her application.

Helen is a highly qualified English teacher who has significant management experience. She recently completed a master's degree in English language teaching, and she became our Assistant Director of Studies earlier this year. Helen was given this post because she demonstrated exceptional organizational, team building and course development skills during her first four years with us.

Helen's students and colleagues describe her as dedicated, hard-working and enthusiastic. I believe that her professionalism in the classroom and her commitment to her colleagues' development make Helen the perfect candidate for a full-time Director of Studies position.

If you have any further questions about Helen's suitability for the post, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Your faithfully,

Boris Corbin
