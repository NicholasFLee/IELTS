Dear Simone,

I hope you're well. I'm just writing to offer you a concert ticket that I won't be able to use.

Do you remember that I told you I was going to a gig this Saturday? There's an up-and-coming singer and guitarist who's playing at the Apollo Theatre; I think you'll be blown away by how good he is. The concert starts at 7pm, but there's a support act on first, so you can arrive a bit later if you only want to catch the main performance.

The reason why I'm offering you my ticket is that I've been asked to visit a client in Germany to help with a product launch and I won't be back until Monday.

If you're free on Saturday evening and you'd like to go, just speak to my brother. He'll be going to the gig, so you won't be alone, and you can arrange to meet beforehand or outside the venue on the night.

I hope you can make it, and that you enjoy the concert!

See you soon

Nick
