Your son is learning a second language at school, but he needs some extra lessons.

Write a letter to a teacher asking for her help. In your letter

 · explain why your son needs help
 · ask the teacher about her teaching experience and methods
 · and suggest a possible schedule for the lessons.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Key things to highlight: son needs extra language lessons, explain why, ask about experience and methods, suggest schedule

Choose the tone: assume we don't know the teacher = formal

Greeting: e.g. Dear Mr. Smith (assume we know the teacher's name)

Ending: Yours sincerely, (then invent a name)

Overall purpose: ask the teacher to help your son

Paragraph structure: single sentence to state the purpose, then one paragraph for each bullet point

Paragraph aims: explain, request, suggest

Ideas: Your son has missed a term of Spanish lessons due to illness; looking for an experienced teacher who knows the school exams; son is available for private lessons at home any weekday after school

Dear Mr. Smith,

I am writing to ask whether you are available to help my son with some after-school Spanish lessons.

My son, Tom, missed the majority of the autumn school term due to illness, and he is struggling to catch up. His problems in Spanish lessons stem from the fact that he was off school when the teacher introduced some new verb tenses, He was also unable to attend a course of pronunciation lessons, and so he lacks confidence when asked to speak in front of the other students.

Can I ask you about your experience teaching high school students? Are you familiar with the curriculum, in particular the grammar and vocabulary topics that are covered in year 9? Perhaps you could also tell me a little about the methods you use to build students' pronunciation and conversation skills.

Tom is free every weekday after school, so I was hoping that you could come to our house to teach him in the late afternoon or early evening. Two lessons per week would be ideal.

I hope to hear from you soon, and that you will be able to help.

Yours sincerely,

Paul Jones
